            <h2>What is Poverty?</h2>
            <p>Poverty is defined as the state of one's living conditions based on their financial position. Many are considered to be living in poverty due to various social, economic, and political factors. Internationally, poverty is often measured by daily income. For example, individuals living on less than $2.15 per day (or even $1.90, depending on the measure) are classified as living in extreme poverty.</p>
            <p>In Wales, research such as the 2016-17 National Survey for Wales indicated that 1% of households had received food from a food bank in the last 12 months, hinting at local challenges that echo global trends.</p>

        <!-- Why and How Section -->
        <section id="why-how">
            <h2>Why and How Does Poverty Occur?</h2>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>Although poverty does not have a single cause, several factors contribute to it. Commonly, these include rising living costs (food, rent, bills, etc.), low wages, and a lack of job opportunities—especially for specific groups. These factors create a cycle that perpetuates poverty both locally and globally.</p>

            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p>Today, poverty is addressed in various ways including charitable efforts, community awareness campaigns, and social initiatives. However, despite these efforts, poverty rates in many places remain high or are even growing. By increasing awareness and instituting targeted measures (such as international laws), there is hope for significant reduction in poverty levels.</p>

        <!-- Rationale Section -->
        <section id="rationale">
            <h2>Rationale</h2>
            <p>The project is built on three main reasons, focusing on how reducing poverty can have a ripple effect in improving economic stability, enhancing public services, and reducing other major social issues. By addressing poverty, we open the door to higher consumer demand, business growth, increased tax revenue, and overall societal well-being.</p>

        <!-- PESTLE Analysis Section -->
        <section id="pestle">
            <h2>PESTLE Analysis</h2>
            <h3>Political</h3>
            <p>Providing people with their basic needs can reduce violence and conflicts within communities.</p>
            <h3>Economic</h3>
            <p>Reducing poverty increases disposable income, boosts consumer demand, and expands the middle class—ultimately driving economic growth.</p>
            <h3>Social</h3>
            <p>Improved economic conditions lead to better healthcare, increased participation in social activities, and overall higher quality of life.</p>
            <h3>Technological</h3>
            <p>A reduction in poverty means more individuals can participate as innovators, creators, and consumers, accelerating technological advancements.</p>
            <h3>Legal</h3>
            <p>With more resources available, legal systems improve and crime rates can decrease, leading to a more secure society.</p>
            <h3>Environmental</h3>
            <p>Reducing poverty can lessen the reliance on harmful practices such as illegal wildlife trafficking and promote access to clean energy.</p>
