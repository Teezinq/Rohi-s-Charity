      <h2>What is Poverty?</h2>
      <p>Poverty is defined as the state of one's living conditions based on their financial position. Many people are classified as living in poverty due to various social, economic, and political factors. Internationally, poverty is often measured by daily income—individuals living on less than $2.15 (or $1.90, depending on the measure) are considered to be in extreme poverty.</p>
      <p>In Wales, research such as the 2016-17 National Survey for Wales noted that 1% of households had received food from a food bank in the past 12 months, highlighting local challenges that mirror global trends.</p>

    <!-- Why and How Section -->
    <section class="content-section" id="why-how">
      <h2>Why and How Does Poverty Occur?</h2>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <p>Poverty arises from a mix of factors—rising living costs, low wages, lack of job opportunities, and systemic issues. These challenges create a cycle that perpetuates poverty both locally and globally.</p>
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <p>Efforts to tackle poverty include charitable initiatives, community awareness campaigns, and policy changes. However, despite these actions, poverty rates remain high in many areas, underscoring the need for continued and targeted efforts.</p>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Rationale Section -->
    <section class="content-section" id="rationale">
      <h2>Rationale</h2>
      <p>Reducing poverty has a multiplier effect—improving economic stability, public services, and social well-being. By addressing poverty, we pave the way for higher consumer demand, business growth, increased tax revenue, and overall societal improvement.</p>

    <!-- PESTLE Analysis Section -->
    <section class="content-section" id="pestle">
      <h2>PESTLE Analysis</h2>
      <h3>Political</h3>
      <p>Providing basic needs helps reduce conflicts and social unrest.</p>
      <h3>Economic</h3>
      <p>Reducing poverty boosts disposable income, which in turn increases consumer demand and spurs economic growth.</p>
      <h3>Social</h3>
      <p>Better economic conditions lead to improved healthcare and social engagement, raising overall quality of life.</p>
      <h3>Technological</h3>
      <p>When more people participate in the economy, it drives technological innovation and access.</p>
      <h3>Legal</h3>
      <p>A stronger economy supports better legal enforcement and reduces crime rates.</p>
      <h3>Environmental</h3>
      <p>Reducing poverty lessens the need for environmentally harmful practices and promotes sustainable resource use.</p>

      <h2>Articles and Research Findings</h2>
      <p>Below are key articles and facts from various sources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>World Bank:</strong> Efforts over 30 years reduced global extreme poverty, but the COVID-19 pandemic increased numbers by 70 million. (Extreme poverty rate rose to 9.3% in 2019; up to 685 million people may still be in extreme poverty by the end of 2022.)</li>
        <li><strong>Compassion:</strong> Nearly one in ten people worldwide live below the international poverty line, with 689 million surviving on less than $1.90 a day.</li>
        <li><strong>Brookings:</strong> In 2015, 728 million people lived in poverty, though challenges remain, especially in Africa.</li>
        <li><strong>World Vision:</strong> 9.2% of the global population lives on less than $2.15 a day, with extreme poverty concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa.</li>
        <li><strong>The Guardian:</strong> Since 1981, about 1 billion people have escaped extreme poverty, though 9.1% of the global population was estimated to be in poverty in 2016.</li>
        <li><strong>UN Global Compact:</strong> Approximately 10% of the global population lives in extreme poverty, influenced by conflicts, climate change, and COVID-19.</li>
        <li><strong>DoSomething.org:</strong> Highlights that poverty is multifaceted—beyond income, it includes access to healthcare, education, and housing.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Health (Northern Ireland):</strong> Economic inequality significantly impacts health, with higher poverty rates in Northern Ireland compared to Great Britain.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Abstract Section -->
    <section class="content-section" id="abstract">
      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>Poverty is not an unsolvable problem but an outcome of policy, systemic issues, and choices. Addressing it could trigger a domino effect, helping to alleviate many other global challenges.</p>
